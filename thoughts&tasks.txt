1. the confidence is high even when crop is not good - mid-2-letters.
2. sometimes high confidence for wrong letter, although crop is good 
3. cant be a ui solution since probably wont run this one by one
4. not just heb? and in high conf. tries to use the closest visual 
5. future - add padding for each crop to get the full letter nuances






UI & functions:

1. no feedback that an image was uploaded
2. log - keep scroll bar
3. hover feedback
4. cmd line run + folder-sub-folder run?
5. give each image delete icon or checkbox - so we can edit the image pool before download for cleaness
