minimal, working Node + Tesseract.js pipeline that:

OCRs a single image in Hebrew

Writes the raw TSV

Crops each symbol (glyph) to individual PNGs

Saves a compact metadata.json per crop

Later: generalize to batch folders, per-glyph buckets, and GlyphCollector-style functions. (see : https://github.com/krksgbr/glyphcollector)
